# Wordle

A simple clone of the popular wordle game!

# How does this work:

- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) as a base!
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for the icons!
- [react-confetti-boom](https://github.com/almond-bongbong/react-confetti-boom) for the confetti üòÅ

Every day at 12 AM (00:00) UCT a github action is run to pick a new word from the wordlist! <br/>
This approach makes it easy to simply look at the possible words and today's solution, but can simply run without a server (except for the action)!
